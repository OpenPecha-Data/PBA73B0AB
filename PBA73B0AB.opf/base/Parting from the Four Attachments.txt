Behaviour that goes against the Dharma must be stopped,And so, in order to practise the Dharma
correctly,Here is the instruction on ‘Parting from the Four Attachments’,Which now I shall
offer to your ears:

“If you are attached to this life, you are not a true spiritual practitioner;If you are attached
to saṃsāra, you have no renunciation;If you are attached to your own self-interest, you
have no bodhicitta;If there is grasping, you do not have the View.”

1. Relinquishing Attachment to This Life

The first step is to relinquish attachment to this life:Discipline, study, reflection and meditationUndertaken
for the sake of just this life—Give them all up, for they are not the Dharma!To
begin with, to practise discipline is to possessThe cause for reaching higher realms,The
stairway to liberation,And the remedy that eliminates suffering.Without discipline,
nothing is possible,But if it is observed out of attachment to this life,You have the root
cause of the eight worldly concerns.You criticize those with poor conduct,You are envious
of the truly disciplined,It turns your own discipline into mere hypocrisy,And it sows the
seeds of birth in the lower realms:So give up this fake and fabricated discipline!A person
who pursues study and reflection,Possesses the wealth of acquiring all knowledge,Holds
a torch that dispels ignorance,Knows the path on which to lead living beings,And has got
the seed of the dharmakāya.Study and reflection, then, are indispensable,But those who pursue
them out of attachment to this life,Possess instead the riches of pride and arrogance,Scorn
for those of lesser learning and contemplation,And envy for all who accomplish genuine
study and reflection.Forever seeking disciples and wealth,They own the root cause for reaching
lower realms:So give up study and reflection motivated by the eight worldly concerns!All
those who train in meditation,Possess the remedy for negative emotions,The basis for
accomplishing the path to liberation,The wealth of realizing the natural stateAnd the seed
for attaining buddhahood.Meditation, then, is indispensable,But those who meditate with
only this life in mind,Find busyness and entertainment even in seclusion,Turn their recitation
practice into meaningless talk,Disparage those who truly study and reflect,And are jealous
of other meditators,While their own practice is pure distraction:So give up your meditation
on the eight worldly concerns!

2. Relinquishing Attachment to Saṃsāra

In order to attain nirvāṇa, beyond all sorrow,Abandon attachment to the three realms of saṃsāra.And
in order to relinquish attachment to the three realms,Reflect on the faults of saṃsāric
existence:First, there is suffering upon sufferingWhich is the suffering of the three
lower realms.Contemplate this deeply and you will break out in goose pimples;If it actually
befalls you, it will be beyond your power to endure.But by failing to practise the virtue
of restraint,You keep on tilling the fields of the lower realms,And there, wherever you
find yourself, how dreadful it will be!Contemplate the suffering of change,And how you can
fall from higher to lower realms,How Indra, lord of gods, can be reborn as an ordinary
mortal,The sun and moon can turn dark,And the emperor of the world can be reborn as a humble
servant.Such examples are to be trusted as they come from the scriptures,Yet they are hard
for ordinary beings to comprehend.So just look then, with your own eyes, at the changes
among humans:The wealthy turn into beggars,The powerful grow weak,Out of many people, only
one survives...And so on, beyond our mind’s imagining.To contemplate the suffering of conditioning,See
how there is never an end of things to do,And suffering is found among the
many and the few,Among the well-off and the starving alike.Our whole human life is spent
preparing,And in the midst of our preparing, we are swept away by death;But not even in death
is there any end to preparation,As once again we begin making ready for the next life.How
perverse they are who keep clingingTo this heap of misery that is samsara!When free from
such attachment, there is nirvāṇa,And in nirvana, the attainment of lasting bliss.I sing
of my realization—freedom from attachment to this life and saṃsāra.

3. Relinquishing Attachment to Our Own Self-Interest

Yet to liberate myself alone will bring no benefit,For sentient beings of the three realms are
all my fathers and mothers.How disgusting to leave my parents in the thick of suffering,While
wishing and seeking for just my happiness alone!So may the suffering of all the three
realms ripen on me,May my merits be taken by sentient beings,And through the blessings
of the merit of this,May all beings attain buddhahood!

4. Relinquishing Attachment to Self-Existence

Yet no matter how far I have progressed in the Dharma,As long as there is grasping at self,
there is no freedom.To elaborate in more detail:If you grasp at existence, there is no liberation;If
you grasp at non-existence, there are no higher rebirths;If you grasp at both,
you are just ignorant,So do the best you can, to remain in non-duality!All things and events
are the domain of the mind:So without searching for a creator of the four elements,Such
as mere chance or an almighty god,Do the best you can, to rest in mind’s innermost nature!The
nature of appearances is like a magical illusion,And the way they arise is through interdependence:That’s
the way things are, which cannot be expressed in words,So do the best
you can, to dwell in a state which is inexpressible!By the merit of this virtue—Explaining
the ‘Parting from the Four Attachments’,May all the seven classes of living beingsBe led
to the perfect ground of buddhahood!
