Three Principal Aspects of the Path

by Je Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa

Homage to the precious noble masters!

The very essence of all the buddhas’ teachings,The path that is praised by the noble bodhisattvas,And
the entrance for all fortunate ones desiring liberation—To the best of my ability,
I shall now set forth.You who are unattached to saṃsāra’s pleasures,And strive to make
full use of the freedoms and advantages,You who follow the path delighting all the buddhas—Fortunate
ones, listen well, with a clear and open mind.Whilst lacking pure renunciation
there is no way to pacifyThe continual thirst for pleasure in the ocean of saṃsāra,And since
all living beings are bound by their craving for existence,You must begin by finding the
determination to be free.The freedoms and advantages are rare, and there’s no time to waste—Reflect
on this again and yet again, and dispel attachment to this life.To dispel attachment
to your future lives, contemplate repeatedlyThe unfailing effects of karma and the
sufferings of saṃsāra.When, through growing accustomed to thinking in this way,Hope for the
pleasures of saṃsāra no longer arises even for an instant,And throughout both day and night
you long for liberation,Then, at that time, true renunciation has been born.Yet if this
renunciation is not embracedBy the pure motivation of bodhicitta,It will not become a cause
for the perfect bliss of unsurpassed awakening,So the wise should generate supreme bodhicitta.Beings
are swept along by the powerful current of the four rivers,[1]Tightly bound
by the chains of their karma, so difficult to undo,Ensnared within the iron trap of their
self-grasping,And enshrouded in the thick darkness of ignorance.Again and yet again, they
are reborn in limitless saṃsāra,And constantly tormented by the three forms of suffering.[2]This
is the current condition of all your mothers from previous lives.Contemplate their
plight and generate supreme bodhichitta.If you lack the wisdom that realizes the nature of
things,Although you might grow accustomed to renunciation and bodhicitta,You will be incapable
of cutting through conditioned existence at its root.Exert yourself, therefore, in
the methods for realizing interdependence.The one who sees that cause and effect operate infalliblyFor
all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,And for whom any objects of conceptual
focus have subsided,Has set out upon the path delighting all the buddhas.The knowledge
that appearances arise unfailingly in dependence,And the knowledge that they are empty and
beyond all assertions—As long as these two appear to you as separate,There can be no realization
of the Buddha’s wisdom.Yet when they arise at once, not each in turn but both together,Then
through merely seeing unfailing dependent originationCertainty is born, and all
modes of misapprehension fall apart—That is when discernment of the view has reached perfection.When
you know that appearances dispel the extreme of existence,While the extreme of
nothingness is eliminated by emptiness,[3]And you also come to know how emptiness arises as
cause and effect,Then you will be immune to any view entailing clinging to extremes.When,
in this way, you have correctly understoodThe key points of the three principal aspects
of the path,Withdraw to solitude, dear son, strengthen your diligence,And swiftly accomplish
the ultimate and lasting aim.
