Garland of Jewels

Homage to great compassion!Homage to the deities who inspire faith and devotion!Homage to the
masters!

Be done with doubt and indecision,And embrace your practice with all your heart.Shake off lethargy,
dullness and laziness,And strive always with enthusiasm and joy.

Mindful, vigilant and careful,Guard the doorways of your senses at every moment.Three times
each day, three times at night,Again and again, examine your thoughts.

Make plain your own failings,But don’t look for faults in others.Make known the good points
of others,But keep quiet about your own best qualities.

Let go of craving for gain and honour,
And give up the urge for profit or fame.

Cultivate love and compassion,And make your bodhicitta stable.Avoid the ten unwholesome actions,And
make your faith and confidence be strong.

With few wants, be content with what you have,And with gratitude repay any kindness you receive.

Overcome anger and arrogance,And let humility rule your mind.Give up any unwholesome kind of
living,And pursue a livelihood in keeping with the Dharma.

Do away with your addiction to material things,And adorn yourself with the riches of the Āryas.

The wealth of faith, of discipline,Generosity and learning,Decency, self-control,And wisdom—such
are the seven riches.These most sacred forms of wealthAre seven treasures that never
run out.Do not speak of this to those who are not human.

Leave all busyness and distraction behind,
And dwell instead in seclusion and solitude.

Refrain from meaningless chatter,
And always keep a check on what you say.

Whenever you see your master or preceptor,Offer to serve them with devotion and respect.Those
who possess enlightened visionAnd those first setting out upon the path—Regard them both
as your spiritual teachers.

Whenever you see any sentient beings,Regard them as your parents or your children.Don’t befriend
those who act in harmful ways;Instead rely on true spiritual friends.

Drop any feelings of hostility or ill will,
And be happy, wherever you choose to go.

Avoid getting attached to anything at all,And stay free from craving and desire.Attachment not
only keeps you from happy births,It kills the very life of liberation.

Should you find a way to peace and happiness,Strive constantly to put it into practice.Whatever
task you set out to do,Accomplish that very thing first.This way, everything will turn
out well;If not, nothing will succeed.

Never take pleasure in acts that harm.And when thoughts of superiority creep in,There and then,
deflate your self-importance,And recall your master’s personal advice.Or whenever you
feel discouraged or inadequate,Raise your spirits and encourage yourself.And always meditate
on emptiness.

Should the objects of attachment or aversion appear,View them as no more than illusions or projections.Should
you hear unpleasant words,Consider them nothing more than echoes.Should
you suffer physical harm,See it as the result of your past actions.

Keep entirely to solitude, far away from town,And, like the carcass of some wild animal,Stay
hidden in nature by yourself,Free of all entanglement and attachment.

Always keep up your pledges and commitments,And should laziness or procrastination strike,Immediately
take note of your errors, one by one,And remind yourself of the heart of your discipline.

Whenever you meet another person,Speak calmly, sincerely and truthfully.Take care not to frown
or glare,And always wear a cheerful smile.

And when you’re with those you see every day,Don’t be stingy, but be happy to give,And banish
all feelings of envy.

So as to protect others’ peace of mind,Stay clear of quarrels of any kind,And be patient and
always forbearing.

Don’t flatter, or be a fickle friend,But be steadfast and reliable all the time.Never disparage
or belittle other people,But treat everyone with respect.

When giving advice or instructions,Do so with compassion and a genuine wish to help.Be sure
never to criticize the teachings.Set your sights on what inspires you most,And, through the
ten forms of Dharma practice,[1]Exert yourself in sessions, day and night.

Among others, keep a check on your speech;
When alone, keep a check on your mind.

Whatever virtues you amass in the past, present and future,Dedicate them all towards great,
unsurpassable awakening,Share your merit among all sentient beings,And with the seven branch
practice,Continually make great prayers of aspiration.

Practising like this, you will completeAccumulations of both merit and wisdom,And eliminate
the two forms of obscuration.You will make this human life meaningful,And, in time, gain unsurpassable
awakening.

This concludes the Bodhisattva’s Garland of Jewels, composed by the great Indian paṇḍita Dīpaṃkara
Śrījñāna.
