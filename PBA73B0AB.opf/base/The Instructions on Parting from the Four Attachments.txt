The Instructions on Parting from the Four Attachments

Oṃ Svasti Siddham!

When he reached the age of twelve, the great Sachen Kunga Nyingpo undertook a six-month practice
of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. One day he had a vision, in which he actually saw, amidst
a brilliant blaze of light, the holy Lord Mañjuśrī, orange in colour and seated on a jewelled
throne, his feet placed flat upon the ground, his hands in the mudrā of explaining the
Dharma, and with an attendant bodhisattva on either side.

Mañjuśrī spoke to him:

“If you are attached to this life, you are not a true spiritual practitioner;If you are attached
to saṃsāra, you have no renunciation;If you are attached to your own self-interest, you
have no bodhicitta;If there is grasping, you do not have the View.”

When Sachen Kunga Nyingpo examined the truth of these words, he understood that the entire practice
of the path of the pāramitās was condensed into training the mind in parting from
these four attachments, and he attained a special conviction and insight into all the teachings
of the Dharma.

Samāptamithi!
